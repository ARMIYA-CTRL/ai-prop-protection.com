# Privacy Policy for AI-Prop-Protection

**Last Updated:** [Datoen du udgiver den]

This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the AI-Prop-Protection browser extension.

## 1. Core Principle: No Data Collection

AI-Prop-Protection is designed with user privacy as its highest and most fundamental principle.

*   **We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data.**
*   **We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your browsing activity, chat history, or any content from the web pages you visit.**

## 2. How the Extension Works

All analysis performed by this extension happens **locally on your computer, within your browser**.

1.  The extension contains a predefined, local list of propaganda-related domains and keywords.
2.  When you manually trigger a scan, the extension's script is injected into the active webpage.
3.  The script reads the visible text on the page in real-time.
4.  It compares this text against its local lists.
5.  If a match is found, it displays a warning banner directly on the page for you to see.
6.  The text that was read is immediately discarded from memory after the scan. It is never stored or sent anywhere.

The extension is entirely self-contained and does not communicate with any external servers.

## 3. Permissions

The extension requires the minimum permissions necessary to function:
*   **`scripting` & `activeTab`:** To allow the extension to inject its scanning script into the page you are currently viewing *when you click the button*.
*   **`storage`:** This permission is included for potential future features, such as allowing users to customize their settings. It is not used in the current version.
